This question asks you to implement and experiment with the basic recursive algorithm given at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation by squaring. It has two main tasks.
Read in a sequence of integer pairs x and y. Task 1 is to output the last 8 digits of the function
pow(x; y) = xy. Task 2 is to compute how many multiplications was required to do this using the
standard squaring exponentiation algorithm. Here the xy represents exponentiation operator (raise x
to the power of y). Input is terminated with x = y = 0. You can assume both integers x and y are
nonnegative and at most 8 decimal digits in length.
Sample Input:
3 4
2 5
10 6
10 8
6 13
0 0
Sample Output (for program that returns last 8 digits of answer) :
81
32
1000000
00000000
60694016
Sample Output (for program that counts minimum multiplications) :
2
3
3
3
5
