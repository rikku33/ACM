A professor assigned a program to his class for which the output is a string of lower-case letters.
Unfortunately, he did not specify an ordering of the characters in the string, so he is having diculty
grading student submissions. Because of that, he has requested that ICPC teams help by writing a
program that inputs pairs of strings of lower-case letters and determines whether or not the strings
have the same letters, though possibly in dierent orders. Note that repeated letters are important;
the string \abc" and \aabbbcccc" are not viewed as having the same letters since the second one has
more copies of each letter.
Input
Input to be processed will be pairs of lines containing nonempty strings of lower-case letters. All input
will be valid until the end of le indicator. End of le will be signaled by two lines that contain just
the word `END' in upper case. No input line will be longer than 1,000 characters.
Output
Report whether pairs of strings have the same letters or not. Follow the format exactly: `Case', a space,
the case number, a colon and one space, and the result given as `same' or `different' (lower-case, no
punctuation). Do not print any trailing spaces.
Sample Input

Sample Output
Case 1: same
