Most people are aware of the importance of selecting a good password for their computer and e-mail
accounts. However, they pay little attention when they choose their credit card and bank card PINs,
even though they can probably unlock a lot of wealth.
Your task is to write a program to assess the security level of a collection of PINs. A PIN that
contains the same digit three times or a sequence of three consecutive digits (such as 345 and 654) is
to be assessed as weak. Otherwise, it is considered acceptable. Note that sequences that wrap around,
like \391312" and \098165", are not considered consecutive.
Input
The input starts with an integer N, on a line by itself, that represents the number of test cases.
1  N  1000. The description for each test case consists of a six-digit non-negative number on a line
by itself.
Output
The output consists of a single line, for each test case, which contains your program's assessment of
the PIN as `WEAK' or `ACCEPTABLE'.
